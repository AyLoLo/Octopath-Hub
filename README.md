# Phase-2-Traveler-Project
A front-end application displaying characters and their related information from the popular video game series "Octopath Traveler". The project originally was one of the first 
experiences I personally had with creating an application and so I wanted it to relate to a personal interest of mine. The concept of character cards was something I thought uniformly
would be fun to use and personalize especially when there is a lot of material to work with. "Octopath Traveler" has an immense roster of characters that span not just from their main entries for the Nintendo Switch
but also from their phone application, "Champions of the Continent", and each character has an in-depth lore that contributes to the world-building of the game. During the development
of the project, I soon came to realize that despite that "Octopath Traveler" and "Octopath Traveler 2" had existing website applications that displayed information on the characters and region,
"Champions of the Continent" did not. With that in mind, I wanted to steer the direction of the project in being able to add and update information on not just existing characters, but also new and expected ones from the series.

The intent of the website is to inform an user on what "Octopath Traveler" is , and the characters that make-up the world the game series takes place in. To achieve this, the user
is first introduced to a home page where a short summary of the game series is on display, and additional video trailers for each of the entries in the series. A user can navigate 
to multiple routes where one could add a character card, see a full roster of characters, or just the main roster of characters from "Octopath Traveler" or "Octopath Traveler 2".
A character card would typically display a character's name, a quote, and their profession alongside their pixel art as they would appear in the game (At this time there isn't an available gif for AGNEA BRISTARNI). Upon clicking the characer card pixel picture, an alternate picture of the character
would be displayed and their story background. Clicking on the image again would revert the character card to it's default state. Clicking on "Traveler List" would direct a user 
to a roster of all the characters from the collected entries in the series, in addition to a search bar that can search a character by their name or profession. Lastly, clicking on "New Traveler, a user would
be directed to a form where one could add a character card by filling out the appropiate fields. In the event that all fields are empty and a user submits a form anyways, a  gag default character
card is generated and added to the roster list. 

A lesson that can be taken from the project is that resources such as images and gifs may not be readily available to you for all fields of information so it is best to first secure
resources first in an uniform matter before creating fields for them. There were many different attempts at creating character cards and even when I had thought I figured it out, I came to the 
unfortunate conclusion that AGNEA BRISTARNI was the only character that did not have a media I was looking for. Character cards must be alligned and displayed in an uniform matter for clean presentation
so for the future I would want to make sure I have all the correct media resources available to me before decided to create cards.
